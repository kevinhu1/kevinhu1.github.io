			<!--
			<p class="text-black" align="left"><img src="images/about/1.png" align="left" class="margin-img"><b>Hai!</b> My name is <b>Kevin Hu</b>, born and raised from the tiny state of <b>Hawai'i</b> on the island of <b>O'ahu</b>.</p>
			<p class="text-black" align="left">My passion lies in applying logic and critical thinking to creatively help others achieve their goals, from marketing to simply pursuing happiness. As I am studying for concurrent degrees in both <b>Computer Engineering</b> as well as <b>Studio Art</b> at the wonderful <b>University of Hawai'i at Manoa</b>, I've come so much closer to making this passion (if you haven't caught on, on this website we'll call this combination <b><i>MAGIC</i></b>) a reality as I graduate next semester in <b>Fall 2014</b>!</p>
			
			<p class="text-black" align="left"><img src="images/about/2.png" align="right" class="margin-img">Believe it or not, there is a <b>science</b> behind <b>everything</b>, even (or especially) in the arts! From the almost-obvious computer science required to code beautiful web pages and mobile apps to being able to <b>direct</b> others on how to make interesting art (to even making your audience do exactly what you want!), it's quite mind-blowing. With an <b>engineering</b> background, I am always striving to logically come up with innovative solutions that actually <b>work</b>.</p>
			
			<p class="text-black" align="left"><img src="images/about/3.png" align="left" class="margin-img"><img src="images/about/4.png" align="right" class="margin-img">When I'm not dealing with engineering or artsy things, I'm <i>always</i> striving to learn more about the world and how everything works. I also love just strengthening my creativity through various forms of non-traditional arts. From the best humor in the form of <b>bad puns</b> (hey, with a last name like Hu, what did you expect?), to learning <i>Everyone's a Little Bit Racist</i> on the <b>piano</b>, it never ends. On the occasion I do like to play some video games, but only a select few. Not those typical shooter games (unless if it's with a <b>camera</b>) or those games that share the same acronym as the most overused expression in chats, but those where I can be more creative. <b>Super Smash Bros Brawl</b>, <b>Pokemon</b>, <b>Mario Kart</b>, <b>Tetris</b>, and <b>Quiz RPG</b> (a mobile app trivia RPG) are my guilty pleasures at the moment, occasionally with some other Nintendo games. Outside of gaming, I'm trying to find the perfect balance between <b>Yelping</b> every single place I love to <b>pig out</b> at and <b>running</b> to get that natural runner's high (and to make up for all the ice cream I dive in for...). The rest of my free time is spent <b>singing</b> horribly at random <b>karaoke</b> places and learning from <b>reading</b> a good old book.</p>
